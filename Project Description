The American Hospital Association is conducting a country wide  analysis to determine the COVID-19 precautions taken by hospitals around the United 
States via twitter data. In this project a total of 46 Illinois hospitals both rural and urban were taken into consideration. 
The total tweet dataset was about 11,000 dated from January 2020 to September 2020. The tools and techniques used were Twint for twitter data scraping, CorEx for
topic modelling to find coherent meaningful topics measured across a corpus of text and finally an in depth exploratory analysis was performed to find the significant 
correlation between topics.A tweeting pattern that has made a considerable impact in generating awareness during COVID-19 by the hospitals is analysed.
